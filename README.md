# Ischolars initiative

The Ischolar initiative (https://ischolarinitiative.org) is a non profit organization that helps bright talents from Nigeria get admission and funding into advanced degree in Europe and North America. This project is an ongoing work to publish the locations and information of all scholars funded by this organization from its inception in 2019 till now. 

This webmapping project utilizes mapbox GL JS Javascript library and a google sheets database from the organization to publish this data. Please feel free to look at the html code, all suggestions are welcome to help improve this project. You can reach me at vawosiji@stanford.edu with an email title of Ischolar. Thank you.
